      <hr>
      <p>
        Founded by George and Maria Papadopoulos, Travel to Greece began with a simple vision: to share the 
        beauty and spirit of Greece with the world. Starting with small, personalized tours to George’s home 
        island of Karpathos, the company has grown into a trusted name in Greek travel, known for its attention 
        to detail, passionate guides, and commitment to sustainable tourism. Today, their children, Nikos and 
        Eleni, continue the family tradition, ensuring that each traveler experiences Greece like a local.
